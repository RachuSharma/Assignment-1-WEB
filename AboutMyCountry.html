                The name of My country is Nepal. It is located in South Asia. China is to the north of Nepal and
                India is to the other three directions. Kathmandu is the Capital city of Nepal.
                <br>

                Nepal can be devided into three physical divisions. They are the Himalayan region,
                the Hillyresin and tarai region with the total area of 1,47,516 square kilo meters.

            Tarai and the valleys. </p>

            <p>Nepal is in the Temperature zone, that is to say, the climate is hot in the summer
                and cold in the winter . But it is very cold in the north, mild in the middle and hot in the
                south. It rain a lot in monsoon season but winter is cold and dry.Rice, wheat, maize, fruits
                and vegetables are grown here.</p> <br>


            <p>Most of the people in Nepal are the Hindis. So it was called a Hindu Kingdom.
                It has been declared as a Secular republic. There are Bhrahimns, Chhetries, Newar,
                Gurugs,Tharus, Magars etc. Who live here We have racial and religious harmony. About 30 million

                Some minerals are found in Nepal. Forest is the main resource of income. Nepal
                rich in water resources. But it is not fully used. Most of people are farmers. Because of
                mountains and hills, cultivable land is not enough and agricultural production is very low.
                It the Tarai belt a lot of rice and other crops are grown. </p>
