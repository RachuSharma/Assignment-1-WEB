            <h2 id="topic">Why I choose Via</h2>
            <p>
                <br>
                I chose Via University because of its practical approach to education and the strong recommendation I
                received from my brother, <br> who is a student. Knowing that Via
                prioritizes hands-on learning and provides valuable real-world skills, I was confident it was the
                <br> right choice for my educational journe.
